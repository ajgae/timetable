`timetable` - a simple ncurses timetable utility
=====

`timetable` is a simple ncurses C application that allows displaying custom. This application is a work in progress and cannot be really used for now, since there is no good user interface for creating or modifying timetables.
Features such as reading text files to get timetable data for displaying, better visual style, event description, or a visual timetable editor might be added in the future.
(since I am an amateur programmer this probably never will get finished but I'm having fun working on it for now so why not ig)
